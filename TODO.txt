- does docker know its own host name? 
   see --add-host on docker run
   
- use git branches as build context (ohhhh)
	https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#git-repositories

- USE modules!

- why does it need UDP for region handshake

- PYOGP login

- add testclient

- add LLVIEWER

- add batch file (in startup.txt) to add test1 user and test2 user

- figure out OpenSim.Console

- consider permissions (no go-rwx)
     run as user opensim

- create "latest/ greatest" dockerfile

- create alpine version (minimal version)
=======
- fix the grid name

- how is SQLlite even working in RPI?
   (looks like it wasnt correctly installed!), dont even need the libraries
