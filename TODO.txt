multiplatform

- does docker know its own host name? 
	not sure why i need this. use $HOSTNAME at runtime
   
- use git branches as build context (ohhhh)

- USE modules!

- why does it need UDP for region handshake

- PYOGP login

- add testclient

- add LLVIEWER

- fix the grid name

- use volume for persistance, create a new network and bridge it with host

- how is persistance actaully working!!!??? (gRPC Fuse messed me UP!)

- fix swarmy "The page you requested has been obsconded with by knomes. Find hippos quick!"
     should meantion get_host_info and OpenSim.ini public setting (if standalone)

- docker build is noisey by default (i set it to use legacy)

- doesnt seem to be caching mono image anymore
