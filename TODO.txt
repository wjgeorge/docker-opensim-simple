- USE modules!

- why does it need UDP for region handshake

- PYOGP login

- add testclient

- add LLVIEWER

- add batch file (in startup.txt) to add test1 user and test2 user

- figure out OpenSim.Console

     run as user opensim

- create "latest/ greatest" dockerfile

- create alpine version (minimal version)
